What is Skeleton?
=================
It's a custom-tailored project skeleton for creating lightweight, semantic websites.

I've cherry-picked the best parts of [HTML5 Boilerplate][1], [Sass][2]-ified the CSS and added a few HTML5 elements for good measure.

Who should use it?
------------------
It's pretty barebones, so it won't be for everyone. If other templates, boilerplates or frameworks didn't quite work out for you, then you might appreciate this one.

If you haven't yet, I highly recommend checking out [HTML5 Boilerplate][1] first and seeing if it meets your needs.

How to use
----------
Most people can just download, unzip and start customizing as they see fit.

If you're weird and don't want to use [Sass][2] for some strange reason, here's what to do:

1. Seriously consider using [Sass][2]. It will make your life easier and more enjoyable.
2. Ok, fine. Delete the `style/sass` directory.
3. Move the `style/compiled/style.css` file up one directory and then delete `style/compiled`.
4. Remember to update your `index.html` file to point to the new location.
5. That's it. Seriously.

Acknowledgements
----------------
I'd like to thank everyone involved with [HTML5 Boilerplate][1]. It's a fantastic project made by people way smarter than me. This project wouldn't exist without all your hard work. Thanks.

Also, the fine folks behind [The Sass Way][3] for writing an awesome function to translate pixels into ems and for the rest of your amazing articles.
