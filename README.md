# What is Fortress?
Fortress is a custom-tailored project skeleton for creating lightweight, semantic websites.

It's pretty barebones, so it won't be for everyone. If other templates, boilerplates or frameworks didn't quite work out for you, then you might appreciate this one.

## Instructions
The default setup will be suitable for most people, but making customizations is easy too. If you change the `assets` directory structure, be sure to update the relative paths found in `index.html` and `build.sh`.

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/). The latest version is recommended (currently 2.3.1), but should work back to 2.0.
1. Install [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install). The latest version is recommended (currently 3.4.22), but should work back to 3.3.0.
3. Ensure that `build.sh` is executable. If it isn't, run `chmod +x build.sh`.
4. Run `./build.sh` to compile Sass & watch for changes.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to everyone involved with [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com). It's a fantastic project made by people way smarter than me. This project wouldn't exist without all your hard work.

Also, the fine folks behind [The Sass Way](http://thesassway.com) for writing an awesome function to translate pixels into ems and for the rest of your amazing articles.
